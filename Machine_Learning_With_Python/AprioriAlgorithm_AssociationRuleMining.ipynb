        "This script uses the mlxtend library, which provides implementations of the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining. Here's a breakdown of the steps:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
        "      Convert the transaction data into a suitable format. Each transaction should be represented as a list of items.\n",
        "\n",
        "**One-Hot Encoding:**\n",
        "        Convert the transaction data into a binary matrix format, where each row corresponds to a transaction and each column represents an item.\n",
        "        Set the value to 1 if the item is present in the transaction, and 0 otherwise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Apriori Algorithm:**\n",
        "        Apply the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets in the transaction data.\n",
        "        The algorithm generates candidate itemsets of increasing length (1-itemsets, 2-itemsets, 3-itemsets, etc.) based on the frequency of occurrence of itemsets in the data.\n",
        "        Prune the candidate itemsets that do not meet the minimum support threshold (minimum frequency of occurrence).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Association Rule Generation:**\n",
        "        From the frequent itemsets generated by the Apriori algorithm, generate association rules.\n",
        "        An association rule consists of an antecedent (premise) and a consequent (conclusion), separated by a '->' symbol.\n",
        "        Calculate various metrics for the association rules, such as support, confidence, and lift.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rule Evaluation:**\n",
        "        Filter the association rules based on user-defined thresholds for metrics like support, confidence, and lift.\n",
        "        Select the rules that meet the minimum threshold criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rule Presentation:**\n",
        "        Display the selected association rules, along with their metrics, to the user for analysis and interpretation."
